keywords = {Fluidized bed reactors, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiphase flow, Internals, Gas bubbles, Defluidized hood},
abstract = {The effect of internals on the fluidization dynamics in three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical fluidized beds was studied using real-time magnetic resonance imaging. Instantaneous snapshots of particle velocity and particle position were acquired for gas velocities U below and above the minimum fluidization velocity Umf. Below Umf, we found local fluidization and gas bubbling in areas adjacent to an inserted horizontal tube, likely caused by the gas locally exceeding Umf as it flows around the insert. Above Umf, the presence of the insert in the bed affected the fluidization dynamics. The wake region above the insert exhibited a lower average particle velocity and reduced velocity fluctuations as well as a substantially reduced number and size of gas bubbles as compared to a reference bed without internals. The extent of this wake region was found to be approximately as wide as the insert, and it extended from the top of the insert to the free surface of the bed. Moreover, the presence of internals also affected the regions below the insert by showing an increased rate of bubble formation directly below the inserted tube. The present work can provide relevant information on the design of fluidized beds with internals. Moreover, the data gathered in this work can be used to validate the accuracy of 3D numerical models of gas-solid systems.}

abstract = {Real-time magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the different flow regimes which occur in a fluidized bed containing a gas injection system. The gas flow rates through the main distributor and a central orifice were varied independently. We identified six different regimes of bubbling and jetting behavior: (1) freely bubbling, (2) permanent jet, (3) spouting, (4) pulsating jet, (5) pulsating jet with bubble collapse and (6) pulsating jet and freely bubbling. While regimes (1–4) have been described previously in the literature, regimes (5) and (6) are described here for the first time. To construct a regime map, the Froude number (Fr) and the ratio of the superficial gas velocity to the minimum fluidization velocity (U/Umf) were used to describe the system. We observed that bubbles formed predominantly, when U/Umf > 1. Further, we propose an empirical model that predicts the length of jets in the permanent jet regime as a function of Fr and background gas flow as ljetdor=0.12Fr0.381+UbgUmf0.81. The proposed model is in good agreement with tomographic measurements in smaller 3D systems reported in the literature, indicating that the non-dimensionalized description of jet length using a Fr number is valid throughout a large range of system diameters. Moreover, the bubble breakoff frequency of the pulsating jet regime was assessed by Fourier analysis, demonstrating that the frequency increases with increasing Fr before plateauing.}

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the hydrodynamics of gas bubbles and particle-laden phase in fluidized beds is essential for the successful design and efficient operation of this type of reactor. In this work, we used real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of three commonly-used baffle geometries on gas bubble behavior and particle motion in a fluidized bed model with an inner diameter of 190 mm. MRI time series of the local particle density and velocity were acquired and used to study the size, number, and shape of gas bubbles as well as the motion of the particle phase. The superficial gas velocity was varied between 1 and 2 Umf. We found that baffles decreased the average equivalent bubble diameter with a simultaneous increase in the total number of bubbles. Moreover, baffles promoted bubble splitting and the formation of air cushions below the baffles and decreased the average particle velocity and acceleration in the bed. For two of the three baffle types investigated, the spatial variation of the particle velocity became larger compared to the bed without internal.}

abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing more accurate and efficient machine learning algorithms for segmentation of medical and natural images. In this review article, we highlight the imperative role of machine learning algorithms in enabling efficient and accurate segmentation in the field of medical imaging. We specifically focus on several key studies pertaining to the application of machine learning methods to biomedical image segmentation. We review classical machine learning algorithms such as Markov random fields, k-means clustering, random forest, etc. Although such classical learning models are often less accurate compared to the deep-learning techniques, they are often more sample efficient and have a less complex structure. We also review different deep-learning architectures, such as the artificial neural networks (ANNs), the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and present the segmentation results attained by those learning models that were published in the past 3 yr. We highlight the successes and limitations of each machine learning paradigm. In addition, we discuss several challenges related to the training of different machine learning models, and we present some heuristics to address those challenges.},
